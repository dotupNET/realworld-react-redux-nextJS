> ### REACT+REDUX+NEXTJS codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **REACT+REDUX+NEXTJS** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **REACT+REDUX+NEXTJS ** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

### Based on the following:

1. Official examples from Zeit `NextJS + React + Redux`: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-redux
2. Realworld `React + Redux` https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app
3. Wesbos's Advanced React https://github.com/wesbos/Advanced-React/tree/master/finished-application/frontend
